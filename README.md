# Running the Hello World Example (on Linux)

Everyone has to start somewhere and, although you may not need the steps below in such detail, there are people who do need some of the steps below. 

1. Open a terminal in the root directory (the folder with the rapidoid-gui, rapidoid-http-client, rapidoid-http-fast, etc.). To do this, navigate to the rapidoid folder in a file browser, copy the folder path, type <code>cd *(path goes here)*</code> into the Bash terminal, and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
2. One time only, run `./bin/build.sh && ./bin/build/build-examples.sh` in the terminal.
3. Run `cd ./examples/hello-world/ && (./app.sh deploy; cd ../..)` in the terminal to start the hello-world on the localhost.
4. Open your web browser to localhost:8888
